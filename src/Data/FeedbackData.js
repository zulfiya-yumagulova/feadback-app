    text: "Switched to the MacBook Air after owning a 2020 Dell Inspiron I7 having read all of the online views and thinking there was no way the MacBook Air could be as impressive as was being stated.I was wrong.This laptop is incredible, it is extremely fast, much much faster than the Dell, in fact the Dell didn’t come anywhere near it in terms of speed.Then there is the battery life, it is on a whole other level, I’ve used it for 6 hours so far and it’s still on 84%, I’ve never used a device, not even tablets, with a battery life that comes anywhere near this.",

    text: "I switched to Macs a few years ago having grown very tired with windows, they are excellent and this MacBook Air is no exception. The machine is beautiful, and very well built, the keyboard is very nice and the battery life is amazing. Also the new M1 chip is awesome, this machine runs rings around my 2018 i7 6 core Mac mini. I know they are expensive but there is a reason for that, they last ages. This MacBook Air was bought to replace my 2013 MacBook Pro which I have now given to my daughter as it still works perfectly. Go on treat yourself !!",

    text: "Best laptop I have ever owned.I finally decided to transition from windows to MacOS and couldn’t have done it at a better time. Super fast, with outstanding battery life. Easily lasts a day of intensive usage.Completely silent and doesn’t heat up. Great value for money, no longer the so-called ‘Apple tax’!",

    text: "I've been using windows my entire life, but when I saw the performance and fan-less design of this new macbook I immediately ordered one and absolutely don't regret it. The MacOS, I got used to it after few minutes of using the macbook, everything there is nicer, smoother and much better organised than windows and I also really like the trackpad gestures which I found especially useful for switching between fullscreen apps very easily. Also the keyboard is very nice to type on and the screen is really beautiful. Battery life is very good too, (4 hours of zoom meetings while browsing safari consumed only about 25 % of battery). And even while playing league of legends the macbook was comfortably warm. Best purchase ever",

    text: "Brilliant new version of the MacBook Air with incredible battery life, superb performance and ease of use. I suppose, if you insist on running Windows OS, this is not the laptop for you but for everyone else it has to be a no brainer. The only minor criticism is that the camera is not the highest resolution but who cares in a laptop? Sound quality is on the other hand surprisingly good. There is also a very similar MacBook the 'Pro' which is about £300 more expensive but doesn't really offer any major advantage so avoid that one and buy this instead. Also avoid the older version of the MacBook Air with the Intel chip, as it struggles under load and will run very hot and noisily when the fan gets going. This one has no fan and is totally silent in operation. Unlike many Apple products this is actually very reasonably priced, especially this version with the Amazon £50 discount. You are stuck with the rose gold colour, which wouldn't have been my first choice, but in fact I rather like it!",
